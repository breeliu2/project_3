# Dr. AI - Remèdes basés sur les symptômes

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a webpage called Dr. AI that displays a list of common symptoms. Users can select their symptoms, and they will be shown a list of remedies, including over-the-counter drugs and other relevant solutions. The webpage will consist of three tabs: Symptom to Disease, Common Symptoms, and Remedies. Users can navigate between these tabs to find information related to their symptoms and potential remedies.

## Data Sources
To build the Dr. AI webpage, we will be using the following Kaggle datasets:

1. [Drugs Related to Medical Conditions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jithinanievarghese/drugs-related-to-common-treatments): This dataset contains information about drugs related to common medical treatments. It will provide us with a comprehensive list of drugs that can be used as remedies for different conditions.

2. [Symptom2disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niyarrbarman/symptom2disease): This dataset includes mappings between symptoms and diseases. It will help us establish connections between symptoms and specific conditions, which is essential for providing accurate remedies to users.

## Technical Implementation
We will develop the Dr. AI webpage using Node.js for server-side programming and PostgreSQL as the database management system. Node.js will allow us to establish a connection with the database, retrieve and manipulate data, and serve it on the frontend. PostgreSQL will store the necessary data for symptoms, diseases, and corresponding remedies.

For data visualization, we will incorporate Leaflet, a JavaScript library, to create interactive and visually appealing maps and charts.

## Project Flow
1. Symptom to Disease Tab: Users will be able to select their symptoms from a predefined list. The webpage will then query the database to identify potential diseases associated with those symptoms.

2. Common Symptoms Tab: This tab will display a list of common symptoms, allowing users to explore and understand symptoms related to various medical conditions.

3. Remedies Tab: Once users have selected their symptoms, this tab will provide them with a list of remedies, including over-the-counter drugs and other relevant solutions for the identified diseases.

## Presentation
During the presentation, each group member will have the opportunity to speak and contribute to the discussion. We will cover the project objectives, the datasets used, the technical implementation details, and showcase the features of the Dr. AI webpage.

By following these guidelines and working collaboratively, we aim to create an interactive and informative webpage that helps users find remedies based on their symptoms. We are committed to meeting the project requirements and delivering a high-quality result.
